Assignment 5

My program supports evaluating a hierarchical, robot-like model. It uses homogenous coordinate representation of 3D points (e.g,. 4-tuples) to apply composite matrix transformations that accomplish the required scaling, translation and rotation operations. The program works by maniuplating the positions of 4 different links based on command-line arguments.

With reference to the image provided for the assignment, the -t parameter determines the theta 1 angle, the -u parameter determines the theta 2 angle, the -v parameter determines the theta 3 angle. The -l value determines the link 1 length, the -m value determines the link 2 length, and the -n value determines the link 3 length.

The most difficult part of this assignment was ensuring that the relevant transformation matricies were applied in the correct order, as matrix multiplicate is non-commutative.

The program is written in C++ on Ubuntu 16.04, using the g++ compiler. The main() function is contained in CG_hw5.cpp.
The class Node.cpp implements a simple means of "writing out" the created graphics objects in Open Inventor format.

It can be compiled via the command 'make'
